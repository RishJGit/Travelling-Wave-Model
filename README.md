# Travelling-Wave-Model
This repository contains several iterations of a MATLAB simulation of a semiconductor laser in a grating-based waveguide, modeled using the Traveling Wave Model and Finite Difference methods.

Anyone interested can run the simulations themselves; just make sure all three MATLAB .m files (SourceFct.m, TLM.m, and wspace.m) are in the same folder before running the simulation.

I've also included two reports I wrote for a fourth-year elective to help explain the purpose and content of each milestone. Note that while these reports are informative, they may not be entirely accurate in all technical details, as they were written during the course.
